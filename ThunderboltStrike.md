# How Thunderbolt Strike Works

- When you deal lightning damage to a Large or smaller creature, you can push it up to 10 feet away from you.

## Best Spells to Trigger Thunderbolt Strike

- [ ] Call Lightning - Your best option, reusable every turn
- [ ] Wrath of the Storm - As a reaction when enemies hit you
- [ ] Lightning Bolt (if prepared) - Hits a line of enemies

## Tactical Coordination with the Knight

Flanking Setup

1. Position yourself on the opposite side of an enemy from your Knight
2. Hit the enemy with lightning damage to push them 10 feet
3. If pushed toward the Knight, they lose their movement options
4. If pushed away from the Knight, it may trigger Attacks of Opportunity

## Creating Attack Opportunities

- Push enemies into hazards: Push them into pits, lava, Spirit Guardians area, etc.
- Break enemy formations: Push defenders away from squishier enemies the Knight wants to reach
- Protect allies: Push enemies away from vulnerable party members

## Combo Tactics

- Push and Chase: You push an enemy, the Knight moves in and attacks, then you push them again on your next turn
- Cornering: Push enemies toward walls/corners where they have limited escape options
- Dragon Lance Charging: Push enemies to positions where the Knight can charge with the dragon lance for extra damage

## Special Situations

- Bottlenecks: Push enemies away from doorways or chokepoints
- High ground: Push enemies off elevated positions
- Water/Lava: In hellish environments, push enemies into environmental hazards

- [ ] Remember that Thunderbolt Strike doesn't provoke Attacks of Opportunity by itself (it's forced movement), but if enemies then choose to move away, they will trigger those attacks from your Knight!
