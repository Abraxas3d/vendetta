# Vendetta's Combat Priority Checklist
## 15th Level Tiefling Tempest Cleric - Chosen of Valkur

### PRE-COMBAT PREPARATION
- [ ] Cast **Bless** on party members if anticipating combat
- [ ] Consider **Protection from Evil and Good** if facing fiends/devils
- [ ] **Water Walk** for tactical mobility if near lava/water in Hell
- [ ] Remember **Divine Strike Feature** At 8th level, you gained Divine Strike, adding 1d8 thunder damage to weapon attacks. Make sure you're using this on every weapon hit.

### COMBAT OPENER (ROUND 1)
1. **First Action Options** (choose based on situation):
   - [ ] **Spirit Guardians** (affects multiple enemies, creates difficult terrain)
   - [ ] **Call Lightning** (if outdoors or high ceilings)
   - [ ] **Spiritual Weapon** (bonus action damage every round)
   - [ ] **Control Water** (if fighting near water/lava)

2. **Bonus Action**:
   - [ ] **Spiritual Weapon** if not already cast
   - [ ] **Healing Word** only if ally is unconscious

### MID-COMBAT PRIORITIES
#### If Party is Healthy (All above 50% HP):
1. **Offensive Focus**:
   - [ ] **Hellfire Trident Attack** + Divine Strike (1d8+2 piercing + 1d8 thunder damage)
   - [ ] **Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath** + Lightning/Thunder spell for max damage
   - [ ] **Hellish Rebuke** (racial) when hit by an enemy attack

#### If Party Needs Support (Multiple allies below 50% HP):
1. **Support Focus**:
   - [ ] **Mass Cure Wounds** for efficient group healing
   - [ ] **Sanctuary** on critically wounded ally
   - [ ] **Dispel Magic** on negative effects
   - [ ] **Healing Word** (bonus action) + offensive cantrip (action)

### HELLISH ENVIRONMENT TACTICS
- [ ] Use **Tiefling Fire Resistance** to your advantage - stand in fire to block enemies
- [ ] Cast **Protection from Energy** (fire) on non-resistant allies
- [ ] **Hellfire Trident** in tight spaces (bonus damage in hellish surroundings)
- [ ] Consider **Create Water** to create steam clouds or difficult terrain

### REACTION DECISION TREE
When hit by attack:
- [ ] Is damage > 10? Use **Wrath of the Storm** (2d8 lightning/thunder)
- [ ] Is it a major enemy? Consider **Hellish Rebuke** (5d10 fire if cast at 4th level which is a good compromise, once per long rest)

When enemy leaves melee range:
- [ ] Use **War Caster** opportunity spell (Command, Inflict Wounds, Guiding Bolt)

### AGAINST DEVILS & FIENDS
- [ ] **Turn Undead/Destroy Undead** won't work on devils!
- [ ] **Sacred Flame** cantrip deals strong damage
- [ ] **Banishment** for removing powerful devils temporarily
- [ ] Remember many devils have resistance/immunity to fire

### EMERGENCY ACTIONS
- [ ] Ally down? **Healing Word** as bonus action to get them up
- [ ] Multiple allies down? **Mass Cure Wounds**
- [ ] Need escape? **Wind Walk**
- [ ] Last resort? **Divine Intervention** or **Plane Shift**

### CONSERVING RESOURCES
- Don't use Channel Divinity on small encounters
- Save 4th and 5th level spell slots for significant threats
- Use cantrips and weapon attacks for minor enemies

### CANTRIP REMINDERS
- **Sacred Flame**: 3d8 radiant damage, ignores cover (good vs. devils)
- **Toll the Dead**: 3d12 necrotic damage if target is injured
- **Thaumaturgy**: Amplify voice, create minor weather effects (on theme!)

### POSITIONING
- Stay within 5ft of frontliners to use **Wrath of the Storm**
- Position to catch multiple enemies in **Spirit Guardians**
- Use **Tempest's Thunderbolt Strike** to push enemies into hazards

*Remember: As Valkur guides ships through storms, Vendetta guides her party through the storms of battle!*
