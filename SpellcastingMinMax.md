Good for large groups of enemies

### Key Tempest Domain Features for Damage

#### Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath - Maximizes lightning/thunder damage

Call Lightning at 5th level + Destructive Wrath = guaranteed 50 damage

Control Weather lightning strike + Destructive Wrath = guaranteed 100 damage

#### Weapon Attacks

Hellfire Trident + Divine Strike

1d8+2 piercing + 1d8 thunder (average 11)

Additional effects in hellish environments

##### Practical Considerations

Single Target Burst: Control Weather + Destructive Wrath (100 damage)

Multiple Targets: Sunburst (12d6 in 60ft radius)

Sustain/Control: Call Lightning with Destructive Wrath when needed

Regular Combat: Spirit Guardians + Spiritual Weapon (sustained damage)

The most damaging option that consistently works well is Call Lightning when upcasted, especially with Destructive Wrath. Control Weather's lightning strikes are technically more powerful but require special conditions.

### Control Weather Requirements and Limitations

Must Be Outdoors: The spell specifically requires you to be outdoors. This rule out using it in dungeons, indoor areas, or many locations in the Nine Hells where you're fighting underground or in structures.

Long Casting Time: It takes 10 minutes to cast, making it useless for combat unless you can prepare well in advance.

5-Mile Radius Area: The spell affects a massive area (5-mile radius) which can have unintended consequences.

Gradual Changes: Weather changes take time to develop:

Takes 1d4×10 minutes for weather to start changing

Takes 1d4×10 minutes more for full effects to manifest

So it could take 20-80 minutes total before you can call lightning strikes

Random Time Delay: The variable timing (1d4×10 minutes) makes it unpredictable and hard to plan around in time-sensitive situations.

Limited Control: While you can generally create storms, you don't have pinpoint control over effects. The lightning strikes require your action to call down, and you need to be able to see where you're targeting.

Concentration: Requires concentration for up to 8 hours, competing with other valuable concentration spells.

Narrative Impact: Changing weather over a 5-mile radius can have significant story consequences - floods, property damage, affecting innocent people, alerting enemies to your presence, etc.

For these reasons, Call Lightning (which takes 1 action, works indoors if storms exist, and gives immediate precise control) is generally more practical for combat. Control Weather is better suited for large-scale strategic situations where you have time to prepare and the story supports massive weather manipulation.
