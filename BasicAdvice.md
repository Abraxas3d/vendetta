# Basic Advice
## The Tempest Cleric is particularly interesting because you're balancing two roles: the storm-wielding damage dealer and the party supporter. 

### Simple Healing Strategy

Don't feel pressured to heal every round - Clerics aren't just healing machines. Sometimes dealing damage or controlling the battlefield prevents more damage than healing would restore.
"Healing Word" is your best friend - It's only a bonus action, leaving your action free for damage or control. Save it for when allies drop to 0 HP to get them back in the fight.
Mass Cure Wounds - Use this for efficient group healing when multiple party members are injured.
For preventative protection: Shield of Faith or Sanctuary on vulnerable allies.

### When to Use Channel Divinity
Your Channel Divinity is one of your most powerful features with two options:

Destructive Wrath (maximize lightning/thunder damage) - Use this with your highest-level lightning or thunder spell when facing multiple enemies or a tough boss.
Turn Undead - Save this specifically for undead encounters to potentially destroy weaker undead outright.

### Spell Preparation Made Simple
Instead of agonizing over your spell list daily, consider having a "core loadout" of spells you almost always prepare:
Always Prepare:

- [ ] Healing Word
- [ ] Mass Cure Wounds
- [ ] Spiritual Weapon (doesn't require concentration!)
- [ ] Spirit Guardians
- [ ] Revivify (just in case)
- [ ] Dispel Magic

Then add 2-3 situational spells based on what you expect that day (underwater adventure? social infiltration? undead enemies?).

### Passive Party Support
Tempest Clerics help the party in ways beyond direct healing:

- [ ] Your Thunderbolt Strike pushes enemies away from vulnerable allies
- [ ] Spirit Guardians creates difficult terrain for enemies
- [ ] Your high Wisdom helps with spotting ambushes and traps

Remember that playing a supportive character doesn't mean you need to sacrifice your character's personality and background. In fact, how Vendetta approaches healing and support can be strongly tied to her devotion to Valkur and her experiences. Perhaps she sees protecting her companions as similar to how a ship's captain protects their crew through storms - sometimes by steering away from danger, other times by weathering it together.
