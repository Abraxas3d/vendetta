# Reaction Options for Vendetta (15th Level Tiefling Tempest Cleric)

1. Wrath of the Storm (Tempest Domain)

Trigger: When a creature within 5ft hits you with an attack

Effect: Force a DEX save (DC 17) or take 2d8 lightning/thunder damage (half on success)

Usage: Reliable damage that pairs well with your theme

Best Used: Against enemies that hit hard but have poor DEX saves

2. War Caster Opportunity Attack

Trigger: When an enemy leaves your melee reach

Effect: Cast a spell instead of making an opportunity attack

Optimal Spells:

Inflict Wounds (3d10 necrotic damage at touch)

Guiding Bolt (4d6 radiant + advantage on next attack)

Command ("Halt" to stop their movement)


Best Used: When you have a powerful spell that can be cast as a reaction

3. Hellish Rebuke (Tiefling Racial)

Trigger: When you take damage from a creature within 60ft

Effect: 5d10 fire damage (DEX save for half)

Usage: Once per long rest, powerful single-target damage

Best Used: Against enemies that deal significant damage to you, especially those with poor DEX saves

4. Shield of Faith Reaction (If active)

Trigger: Various, depends on concentration effect

Best Used: Remember that if you have Shield of Faith or another concentration spell active, consider if it's worth potentially losing concentration to use Wrath of the Storm

### Priority Decision Making

When deciding which reaction to use:

Highest Priority: War Caster opportunity attack on a fleeing high-value target

High Priority: Hellish Rebuke against a powerful enemy that just damaged you significantly

Medium Priority: Wrath of the Storm against enemies with poor DEX saves

Low Priority: Regular opportunity attacks against minor threats

### Tactical Considerations

Conserve Wrath of the Storm for multiple meaningful uses per day rather than triggering it on minor attacks

Remember Hellish Rebuke is once per long rest (at 5th level) - save it for significant moments

Position yourself to force enemies to either stay engaged with you or trigger opportunity attacks

Consider party composition - if allies can also make opportunity attacks, coordinate your reactions
